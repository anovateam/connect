Sends message parts as objects to an Azure File Share. Each object is uploaded with the filename specified with the `path` field.

Introduced in version 4.38.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  azure_file_share:
    storage_account: ""
    storage_access_key: ""
    storage_connection_string: ""
    storage_sas_token: ""
    share_name: foo-share-${!timestamp("2006")} # No default (required)
    path: ${!count("files")}-${!timestamp_unix_nano()}.txt
    max_in_flight: 64
```

In order to have a different path for each object you should use function
interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries), which are
calculated per message of a batch.

Supports multiple authentication methods but only one of the following is required:
- `storage_connection_string`
- `storage_account` and `storage_access_key`
- `storage_account` and `storage_sas_token`
- `storage_account` to access via [DefaultAzureCredential](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#DefaultAzureCredential)

If multiple are set then the `storage_connection_string` is given priority.

If the `storage_connection_string` does not contain the `AccountName` parameter, please specify it in the
`storage_account` field.
